				<p class="mb-4">The State Fisheries Development Corporation Ltd was incorporated on 30.03.1966. It was established originally with the object of implementation of the Master Plan for the development of Fisheries in the Northern and Southern fringes
					of the present Salt Lake.
				</p>
				<p>Subsequently, in order to cope with the ever increasing demand for fish, the corporation was entrusted by the Govt. of West Bengal with the task of fish production and marketing of fish and fish by products. Initially, some Govt. Fish
					Farms were transferred to the Corporation with a view to attaining the goal. The Corporation only acts as an implementing agency and makes optimal utilization of culture in the water bodies as per the provisions of the West Bengal
					Inland Fisheries Act.</p>
