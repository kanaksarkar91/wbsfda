				<h5 class="bottom_line">CULTURE OF PUNTIUS SARANA: </h5>
				<p class="mb-4">Sarpunti is a tropical fresh water endangered fish in India. In West Bengal it is a high demand and high valued fish. Due to high consumer preference, even at smaller size of 100-200 gms. are selling @ Rs. 300/- -Rs. 400/- per Kg.
					The species is a suitable candidate for diversifying the carp culture and also can serve for its conservation. It can culture with IMC specially compatible with both rohu and mrigal. In polyculture with IMC the production can reach
					upto 5 M.T./ Ha./Crop.

				</p>
				<h5 class="bottom_line">CULTURE OF VIETNAM KOI FISH :

				</h5>

				<p class="mb-4">Vietnam Koi fish is commonly known as climbing perch. It is a freshwater air-breathing high priced fish in Bengal. Pond, tanks, Swampy water bodies, reservoir is the native place of this species. Recently a fastest growing Anabas species
					available for pond culture. SFDC are going to culture this species in their Farm for enhancing production and also for more profit.

				</p>
				<h5 class="bottom_line">CULTURE OF SILVER POMPANO :

				</h5>

				<p class="mb-4">Among the many high value marine tropical fin fish that could be farmed in India, the Silver Pompano, Trachinotus blochii is one of the top most, mainly due to its fast growth rate, good meat quality and high market demand. The Silver
					Pompano culture practice has been successfully established in many Asia-Pacific countries like Taiwan and Indonesia. The farming can be successfully carried out in ponds, tanks and floating cages. It is able to acclimatize and
					grow well even at a lower salinity of about 10 ppt. and hence suitable for farming in saline zone. In India the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institutes first time successfully done the induced breeding and larval production
					in 2011 at Mandapam Unit in Tamil Nadu.

				</p>
				<p class="mb-4">In West Bengal, SFDC first time started culture of Silver Pompano at Alampore Fisheries Project near Digha in Purba Midnapore District during May, 2014. Fry collected from CMFRI, Mandapam Unit. Though the ideal salinity for culture
					is 15ppt.-25ppt. but it can tolerate wide range of salinities ie. 5ppt. -40 ppt. Water depth is 1.5mt. is ideal. We stocked about 10000 nos. fry in pond size of .75 ha. Initially given imported Feed from Tiwan with 50% crude protein
					and 10% crude fat combined feed and later used good quality high protein feed. The growth and survivality was very good and can culture in our coastal belt in a big way.

				</p>
				<h5 class="bottom_line">CULTURE OF COBIA:

				</h5>

				<p class="mb-4">Cobia is a warm water large pelagic sea fish. It can grow 2 meters in length and 68 Kg. in weight. Their rapid growth rate and high quality flesh makes the fish one of the marine potential fish for aquaculture. Currently, Cobia are
					cultured in nurseries and grow-out off-shore cages in many parts of Asia, United States, Mexico, Panama, Tiwan, Vietnam and China.

				</p>
				<p class="mb-4">In West Bengal, SFDC has planned to culture this species first time in our earthen pond. The fry will supply by the CMFRI, Mandapam Unit, Tamil Nadu. Very soon the culture will start.

				</p>

				<h5 class="bottom_line">CULTURE OF LITOPENAEUS VANNAMEI :

				</h5>

				<p class="mb-4">Litopenaeus vannamei is a native of pacific coast of Mexico and Central and South America as far as Peru. It is mainly found on mud bottoms, down to a depth of 75 mt. It is commonly known as white legged shrimp. It is grayish-white
					in colour. The maximum weight of the females in the wild is about 120 gms. The males are smaller at 60-80 gms. The optimal range of temperature for the species is between 30 C and 34 C. It can tolerate salinity levels of 0 ppt.
					to 50 ppt. Growth is uniform within 10ppt. to 40 ppt. They can grow in fresh water also but the growth is slower below 10 ppt . pH range 7-9 and dissolved oxygen levels above 4.5 ppm. are required for optimal growth. In culture
					the stocking density ranging from 40/sq. mt. to 150 /sq. mt. due to their less aggressive nature.

				</p>
				<p class="mb-4">SFDC is culturing the species after receiving the Coastal Aquaculture Authority Registration . The production is about 5.0-6.0 M.T./Ha./Crop.</p>-->
